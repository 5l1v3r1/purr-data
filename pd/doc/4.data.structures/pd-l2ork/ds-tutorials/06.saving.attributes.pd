#X text 53 23 Saving attributes is fairly straightforward using message
boxes with commas separating each attribute:;

#X obj 53 57 struct drawtut-attr-saving float x float y;
#X scalar drawtut-attr-saving 53 184 \;;
#X msg 53 117 fill green \, stroke-width 5 \, stroke brown \, stroke-dasharray

#X obj 102 279;
#X text 228 280 <- Create another scalar in the empty object box by
typing the name of the [struct] into it.;
#X text 52 354 Scalars can also save data with the patch. For example
\, the ones above remember their x/y location because that data is
saved as the "x" and "y" fields for each scalar. Each scalar has its
own values for "x" and "y"-- that's we can put the two scalars above
at separate locations in the patch.;
#X text 52 434 We can define more data fields than just "x" and "y".
Later we will use new fields to associate a scalar's data with the
svg attributes \, which will let use change the visual appearance of
each scalar.;
