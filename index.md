Jonathan Wilkes' **Purr Data** a.k.a. **Pd-l2ork** 2.0 is an improved version of Miller Puckette's **[Pd](http://puredata.info/)**. It is based on Ico Bukvic's **[Pd-l2ork](http://l2ork.music.vt.edu/main/make-your-own-l2ork/software/)**, which in turn is a fork of Hans-Christoph Steiner's **[Pd-extended](http://puredata.info/downloads/pd-extended)**.

## About Purr Data

Pd (Pure Data) is a graphical data-flow programming environment which is geared towards real-time interactive computer music and multimedia applications. It is a full-featured open-source alternative to its commercial sibling, Cycling74's [Max](https://cycling74.com/).

Purr Data serves the same purpose, but offers a new and much improved graphical user interface and includes many 3rd party plug-ins. Like Pd, it runs on Linux, macOS and Windows, and is open-source throughout.

Purr Data also offers some notable advancements over "classic" Pd-l2ork:

- cross platform compatibility
- modern GUI written in JavaScript (using [nw.js](https://nwjs.io/))
- improved SVG graphics

Purr Data continues to offer all of Pd-l2ork's GUI and usability improvements, a help browser giving access to help patches in PDDP (Pd Documentation Project) format, and a large collection of bundled 3rd party externals, while using the latest and greatest version of Pd's tried and proven real-time engine under the hood.

## The Name?

Purr Data is the official nickname of the Pd-l2ork 2.x branch. Quite obviously the name is a play on "Pure Data" on which "Purr Data" is ultimately based. It also raises positive connotations of soothing purring sounds, and makes for a nice logo. ðŸ˜º
