Jonathan Wilkes' **Purr Data** a.k.a. **Pd-l2ork** 2.0 is an improved version of Miller Puckette's **[Pd](http://puredata.info/)**. It is based on Ico Bukvic's **[Pd-l2ork](http://l2ork.music.vt.edu/main/make-your-own-l2ork/software/)**, which in turn is a fork of Hans-Christoph Steiner's **[Pd-extended](http://puredata.info/downloads/pd-extended)**.

Pd (Pure Data) is a graphical data-flow programming environment which is geared towards real-time interactive computer music and multimedia applications. It is a full-featured open-source alternative to its commercial sibling, Cycling74's [Max](https://cycling74.com/).

Purr Data serves the same purpose, but offers a new and much improved graphical user interface and includes many 3rd party plug-ins, while still using Pd's tried and proven real-time engine under the hood. Like Pd, it runs on Linux, macOS and Windows, and is open-source throughout.

## The Name?

Purr Data is the official nickname of the Pd-l2ork 2.x branch. Quite obviously the name is a play on "Pure Data" on which "Purr Data" is ultimately based. It also raises positive connotations of soothing purring sounds, and makes for a nice logo.
