Description: L2Ork fork of Pure Data (a.k.a. pd-l2ork) with patches and a
 large collection of externals Pd (aka Pure Data) is a real-time graphical
 programming environment for audio, video, and graphical processing. It is the
 third major branch of the family of patcher programming languages known as Max
 (Max/FTS, ISPW Max, Max/MSP, jMax, etc.) originally developed by Miller
 Puckette and company at IRCAM. The core of Pd is written and maintained by
 Miller Puckette and includes the work of many developers, making the whole
 package very much a community effort.
 .
 Pd was created to explore ideas of how to further refine the Max paradigm
 with the core ideas of allowing data to be treated in a more open-ended way
 and opening it up to applications outside of audio and MIDI, such as graphics
 and video.
 .
 This distribution of Pd is a Linux Laptop Orchestra (L2Ork) variation of
 Pd-extended. It includes a wide array of libraries that allow you to work with
 HIDs, video, OpenGL 3D graphics, and more. It also provides additional
 usability improvements on top of base Pd-extended package. For additional
